- 👋 Hi, I’m @blacklioness
- 👀 I love coding, but hate messy code. 
- 🌱 I've worked with Delphi for several years, but at this moment I've no Embarcadero-license. 
      I've an old certification Java en a recent one in C#, so I stick to those 2 languages for the moment.
- 💞️ I'm not looking for something special, just looking around where I can put my skills to good use.
- 📫 You can reach me on blacklioness78@hotmail.com
